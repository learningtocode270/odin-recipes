# odin-recipes

Hello, this project is a recipe page that uses HTML. I will be demonstrating skills to make a clear and concise webpage while exercising git commands. The goal is to have clean code without errors that is easy to understand to someone who is not familiar with the project. This includes accurate and helpful commit messages.
