        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons millet flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy milk</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water, if needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Chinese black bean sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Asian chile pepper sauce, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>½ green onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon torn fresh cilantro leaves</li>
            <li>2 whole crackers</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk millet flour, soy milk, and vegetable oil together in a bowl to make a batter with the consistency of heavy cream. Add a teaspoon of water to thin the batter, if necessary.</li>
            <li>Mash black bean sauce in a small bowl with 1 teaspoon water to make it easy to spread. Mix hot chili sauce with 1 teaspoon of water in a separate small bowl. Set both sauces aside.</li>
            <li>Spray a large skillet generously with cooking spray, and heat over medium-low heat. Pour batter into the skillet, and spread evenly to make a thin crêpe; cook until firm, about 1 to 2 minutes. Pour egg evenly over crêpe; cook an additional 1 to 2 minutes, until egg is set. Sprinkle crêpe with green onion slices and cilantro leaves, pressing them firmly into cooked egg.</li>
            <li>Flip crêpe and spread with bean sauce and chili sauce. Place crackers in the center of crêpe, leaving about 1/4 inch of space between the two crackers. Flip top third of crêpe down over crackers; flip the bottom third up, and then fold the crêpe in half so the crackers are stacked on top of each other in a tidy package. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
